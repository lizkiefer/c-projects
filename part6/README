Building the program:
Run "make clean all" to build both cipher and genchars

Running the program:
Run ./genchars
It will write the initial generated strings to ./outputfile.txt
That will then be loaded into a queue_t
The contents of that queue will be encrypted using ./cipher
And written out to ./cipherOutput-<PID>.txt, where PID is the ID of the original process

Output may take time to write to the output file even if the original process has exited.

Number of lines in both outputfile.txt and cipherOutput-<PID>.txt should match the stringCount value in genchars.c, which is set to 10000.

cipherOutput-<PID>.txt from previous runs should not be overwritten by new runs.
